# üèéÔ∏è FAF PRICING TABLE - Sales Logic

## The Three Tiers

| Tier | Price | Who It's For |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **CLI + TURBO** | $9/month or $100/year LEGENDS | Individual developers |
| **TEAMS** | $29/month or $300/year LEGENDS TEAM | 2-5 people (up to 5 Turbos) |
| **ENTERPRISE** | Custom ($REWARD) | 25+ people |

---

## Scaling Logic (How Teams Grow)

### Small Teams (1-5 people)
| People | Solution | Monthly Cost | Cost Per Person |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 1√ó CLI + TURBO | $9 | $9.00 |
| 2 | 1√ó TEAMS | $29 | $14.50 |
| 3 | 1√ó TEAMS | $29 | $9.67 |
| 4 | 1√ó TEAMS | $29 | $7.25 |
| 5 | 1√ó TEAMS | $29 | $5.80 |

**Value Proposition:** Teams tier hits $5.80/person at 5 people - that's the floor!

---

### Medium Teams (6-10 people)
| People | Solution | Monthly Cost | Cost Per Person |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 6 | 2√ó TEAMS | $58 | $9.67 |
| 7 | 2√ó TEAMS | $58 | $8.29 |
| 8 | 2√ó TEAMS | $58 | $7.25 |
| 9 | 2√ó TEAMS | $58 | $6.44 |
| 10 | 2√ó TEAMS | $58 | $5.80 |

**Why 2√ó TEAMS?**
- 1√ó TEAMS + 5√ó individual Turbos = $29 + $45 = $74 ‚ùå
- 2√ó TEAMS = $58 ‚úÖ (saves $16!)

---

### Growing Teams (11-24 people)
| People | Solution | Monthly Cost | Cost Per Person |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 11-15 | 3√ó TEAMS | $87 | $7.91 - $5.80 |
| 16-20 | 4√ó TEAMS | $116 | $7.25 - $5.80 |
| 21-24 | 5√ó TEAMS | $145 | $6.90 - $6.04 |

**At 25+ people:** Time to talk Enterprise! üèÜ

---

## Enterprise Threshold: 25+ People

**Why 25?**
1. At 5√ó TEAMS packages ($145/month), you're spending real money
2. Organization needs custom contracts, SLAs, dedicated support
3. Sweet spot for enterprise sales conversations
4. Can offer better pricing + premium features
5. Lock in annual contracts with discounts

**Not 10+:** Too early, still small team territory
**Not 100+:** Too late, left money on the table for mid-sized companies
**25+ is the sweet spot** for enterprise conversations

---

## Key Pricing Rules

### Rule 1: Never Below $5/Person
Teams tier bottoms out at $5.80/person (at 5 people). This maintains value and prevents devaluing the product.

### Rule 2: Self-Optimizing Math
Customers will naturally discover that buying multiple TEAMS packages is cheaper than mixing Teams + individual Turbos. Let them figure it out!

### Rule 3: Enterprise at Scale
25+ people = real organization = custom pricing territory. Don't let them stack TEAMS packages forever.

|------|---------|----------------|---------|

| TEAMS | $29/month ($348/year) | $300/year | $48 |
| ENTERPRISE | Custom | Custom | Negotiable |

**LEGENDS Benefits:**
- üèÜ Legend badge

## The Sales Pitch

**For 1 person:** "Get CLI + TURBO for $9/month. Be a Legend for $100/year."

**For 2-5 people:** "Get TEAMS for $29/month - that's up to 5 Turbos! At 5 people, you're paying $5.80/person vs $9 individual."

**For 6-10 people:** "Grab 2√ó TEAMS packages for $58/month. Way better than mixing individual seats."

**For 11-24 people:** "Stack TEAMS packages as you grow. At 25+ people, let's talk Enterprise."

**For 25+ people:** "You need Enterprise. Custom pricing, SLAs, dedicated support, on-premise options. Let's talk."
