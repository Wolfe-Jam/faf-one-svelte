# üèéÔ∏è FAF TURBO STRATEGY

## The Big Insight
They already have the software (free CLI), so $9 needs to be for **premium add-ons that will NEVER be in the free CLI**.

## The Development Pipeline

### TURBO USERS = INSIDE TRACK
- They get new features FIRST
- They test in production
- When they LOVE it ‚Üí it's approved
- You drop it to free CLI when it's proven

### FREE CLI = STABLE, PROVEN RELEASES
- Gets features that Turbo Pros have battle-tested
- No beta label needed
- "Tested by Turbo Pros" = quality signal
- **v2.5.3 (C-Mirror) = baseline, always free**

## The Flow

```
New Feature ‚Üí Turbo Users (inside track)
           ‚Üì (they love it)
       Approved!
           ‚Üì (drops when ready)
    Free CLI (proven & stable)
```

## Why It Works

1. **Turbo users PAY to be on the bleeding edge**
2. **Free users get rock-solid, proven features**
3. **Built-in QA team that PAYS YOU**
4. **No "beta" label needed** (you don't do that)
5. **CLI lags behind**: 1 week ‚Üí 2 weeks ‚Üí who knows
