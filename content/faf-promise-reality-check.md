# The .faf Promise: We'll Get You to the Starting Line

## The Brutal Reality of Software Projects

9 out of 10 software projects fail. But here's what nobody talks about: many fail for completely preventable technical reasons before they even get a chance to fail for business reasons.

## What .faf Actually Does

**.faf gives you a 90% chance from the TECHNICAL perspective:**
- Code gets written correctly
- AI understands requirements
- Project ships on time
- Technical debt stays manageable
- Team stays productive

**But .faf can't fix:**
- Building the wrong product
- Bad market timing
- Poor business model
- No product-market fit
- Terrible marketing
- Competition crushing you
- Running out of money

## The Real Math

- **Without .faf**: 9/10 projects fail (many for technical reasons)
- **With .faf**: Maybe 7/10 fail (but NOT for business reasons)

.faf removes the technical failure mode. You still might build a technically perfect product nobody wants, but at least you'll ship it on time and on budget to find out!

No more:
- "We ran out of money before we could launch"
- "The codebase became unmaintainable"
- "AI kept building the wrong thing"
- "We're still fixing bugs 6 months later"

## Our Promise

**"We'll get you to the starting line. Whether you win the race is on you."**

We're not selling snake oil. We're selling the ability to actually ship your product so you can find out if it's good or not. That's it. That's the promise.

üèÅ The .faf Promise: "We'll get you to the starting line. Whether you win the race is on you."

9/10 software projects fail. Many never even ship due to technical issues:
‚Ä¢ AI building the wrong thing
‚Ä¢ Context loss causing 2x timeline overruns
‚Ä¢ Technical debt becoming unmanageable

.faf ensures 90% technical success rate. We can't make your idea good, but we can make sure it ships on time and budget so you can find out.

No more dying in development. Ship it and let the market decide.

### Twitter/X Thread

1/ Hot take: Your project doesn't need to be in the 10% that succeed. It needs to be in the 50% that actually ship.

2/ 9/10 projects fail, but many fail before launch due to preventable technical issues:
- AI context loss
- 2x timeline overruns
- Unmaintainable codebases

3/ .faf removes technical failure modes. Our promise: "We'll get you to the starting line. Whether you win the race is on you."

4/ We can't fix bad ideas, poor timing, or weak marketing. But we can ensure you ship on time/budget to find out if your idea works.

5/ Stop dying in development. Ship it and let the market decide.

### Hacker News Comment

The .faf promise is refreshingly honest: "We'll get you to the starting line. Whether you win the race is on you."

After seeing hundreds of projects, the pattern is clear - many teams never get to find out if their idea is good because they burn through runway wrestling with AI context issues, dealing with 2x timeline overruns, or drowning in technical debt.

.faf strips away the technical failure modes. You might still build something nobody wants, but at least you'll ship it on time and on budget to find out. That's a huge improvement over the status quo where teams burn $500k and 18 months to maybe launch a broken MVP.

It's not about guaranteeing success. It's about guaranteeing you get to compete.

### Reddit r/startups

**Title**: We need to talk about the difference between technical failure and business failure

Most startup advice focuses on product-market fit, but here's what I've learned after years in the trenches: Half of startups fail before they even get to test PMF because of technical issues.

- AI constantly building the wrong features due to context loss
- Projects taking 2x longer than planned
- Codebases becoming unmaintainable before launch
- Running out of money during "just one more sprint"

This is where tools like .faf make sense. Their promise is simple: "We'll get you to the starting line. Whether you win the race is on you."

They can't make your idea good, but they can ensure you ship on time/budget to find out. That's actually huge - imagine knowing you'll definitely launch in 12 weeks for $36k instead of maybe launching in 24 weeks for $72k.

The brutal truth: You might build a technically perfect product nobody wants, but at least you'll find out quickly and cheaply instead of dying in development hell.

What's your experience? How many projects have you seen fail technically vs fail in the market?

# Stop Dying in Development: Why Technical Success ‚â† Business Success

![Project Success Rates](banner.png)

We need to have an honest conversation about project failure. Everyone talks about the 90% failure rate of startups, but nobody talks about how many fail before they even get a chance to fail.

## The Two Types of Failure

1. **Technical Failure**: Never shipping, or shipping broken
2. **Business Failure**: Shipping something nobody wants

Here's the kicker - you can only learn from business failure. Technical failure teaches you nothing except that you ran out of money.

This is why the .faf promise resonates: "We'll get you to the starting line. Whether you win the race is on you."

Let's break down what this actually means for your next project...
