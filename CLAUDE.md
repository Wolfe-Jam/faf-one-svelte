## üèÅ GOLDEN RULES - Professional Standards

### Git Commit Protocol (REQUIRED)
**Every commit must follow this exact format:**
```
<type>: <what changed>

- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>
```

**Types:** `fix:` `feat:` `docs:` `refactor:` `chore:` `test:`

**Examples:**
- `fix: Update PR reference to #2759`
- `feat: Add discussions link to navigation`
- `docs: Correct download statistics`

**NEVER:**
- No exclamation marks
- No emotion or excitement
- No marketing language
- No "finally" or "at last"
- No false claims about approval

### NPM Publish Protocol (APPROVAL REQUIRED)
**Before ANY npm publish:**
1. Get explicit approval from wolfejam
2. Verify all claims are factual
3. Update version following semver
4. Test in isolation first
5. Use boring release notes

**Release note format:**
```
v1.2.3

- Fix: Corrected dependency issue
- Feat: Added new command option
- Docs: Updated installation guide
```

### The Professional Standard
- **Boring is good**
- **Facts only**
- **Trust is everything**
- **If Anthropic reads it, would they approve?**
- **When in doubt, make it more boring**

### Critical: Publishing & Committing
- **Git commits**: Follow protocol or don't commit
- **NPM publishes**: Require explicit approval
- **False claims**: Could kill PR #2759
- **Trust violations**: Unforgivable

Remember: We're playing at the level where Anthropic might actually merge our PR. Act like it.
