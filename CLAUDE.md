.faf ensures 90% technical success rate:

What .faf can't fix: bad ideas, poor timing, weak marketing, no product-market fit

## Development Rules - TRUST IS EVERYTHING
1. NEVER add fake statistics or claims
2. NEVER inflate numbers or achievements  
3. NEVER change carefully crafted text without permission
4. Every claim must be verifiable and earned
5. Respect the thousands of hours of work that created this
6. **We have AMAZING REAL facts - use them!**
7. **Our credibility is our superpower**
8. **TRUST is the foundation of the entire .faf brand**

## Testing & Performance
- Target: <50ms per operation (achieved)
- Status: Championship grade performance
- All features must work properly before claiming they do

## üé® Svelte Blueprint Prototyping - Our Design Methodology

**Blueprint first, Svelte second.**

When creating new features or pages:
1. **Design Phase**: Create the prototype using HTML/CSS first
   - Design FOR Svelte (plan component boundaries)
   - Identify where state will live
   - Plan prop flow and component hierarchy
   - Keep CSS organized for easy component extraction
2. **Implementation Phase**: Translate blueprint to Svelte
   - Extract components as planned
   - Move CSS to component scope
   - Add state and reactivity
   - No figuring out design during implementation

This prevents:
- 850+ line CSS soup files
- Emergency refactoring sessions
- Scope creep from "let's just do it"
- Mixing design decisions with implementation

## üè™ GALLERY-SVELTE Component Marketplace

**Location**: `/Users/wolfejam/GALLERY-SVELTE`

All components with monetizable value should be earmarked for GALLERY-SVELTE inclusion.

3. **Success Meter** - With 10% buffer visualization
4. **ImpactDisplay** - Multiplier and delay days display
5. **ComparisonCard** - Before/after comparison cards
6. **ContextPreview** - Dynamic bullet point preview based on percentage
7. **QualityIndicator** - Emoji + color-coded quality levels

### Process for G-S preparation:
- Keep components generic and reusable
- Document props clearly
- Remove project-specific logic
- Include example usage
- Consider theming/customization options

### Immediate Marketplace Opportunities

**Established Marketplaces for Svelte Components:**
1. **Gumroad** - Direct sales, keep 90%+, instant setup
2. **UI8.net** - Premium UI marketplace, good for component packs
3. **Creative Market** - Design-focused, good for stylish components
4. **CodeCanyon** (Envato) - Massive audience, 50-70% revenue share
5. **GitHub Sponsors** - Sponsor-only private repos with components

6. **GitHub** - Public repo with README linking to G-S

**Market Research Approach:**
- Launch with 10-15 solid components

- Offer Figma/design files for premium tier

**Why This Wins:**
- No marketplace fees (100% revenue)
- Direct relationship with customers
- Recurring revenue > one-time sales
- Community-driven = free marketing
- First-mover advantage in Svelte component subscriptions

## üèÅ GOLDEN RULES - Professional Standards

### Git Commit Protocol (REQUIRED)
**Every commit must follow this exact format:**
```
<type>: <what changed>

- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>
```

**Types:** `fix:` `feat:` `docs:` `refactor:` `chore:` `test:`

**Examples:**
- `fix: Update PR reference to #2759`
- `feat: Add discussions link to navigation`
- `docs: Correct download statistics`

**NEVER:**
- No exclamation marks
- No emotion or excitement
- No marketing language
- No "finally" or "at last"
- No false claims about approval

### NPM Publish Protocol (APPROVAL REQUIRED)
**Before ANY npm publish:**
1. Get explicit approval from wolfejam
2. Verify all claims are factual
3. Update version following semver
4. Test in isolation first
5. Use boring release notes

**Release note format:**
```
v1.2.3

- Fix: Corrected dependency issue
- Feat: Added new command option
- Docs: Updated installation guide
```

### The Professional Standard
- **Boring is good**
- **Facts only**
- **Trust is everything**
- **If Anthropic reads it, would they approve?**
- **When in doubt, make it more boring**

### Critical: Publishing & Committing
- **Git commits**: Follow protocol or don't commit
- **NPM publishes**: Require explicit approval
- **False claims**: Could kill PR #2759
- **Trust violations**: Unforgivable

Remember: We're playing at the level where Anthropic might actually merge our PR. Act like it.
